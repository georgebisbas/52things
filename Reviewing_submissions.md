## Thank for for considering reviewing a submission!

This document explains how to review, and what we need from reviewers.

We will try to wait for one review on each article before we edit the piece. Then we'll try to get another read-through by the reviewer.


## What we need

- There's no need to copyedit for grammar and style, we will do that. We also edit for length.
- The main thing is to help us ensure there are no errors, and help the author improve the content.
- Factual errors are a book's worst enemy. Please help us stamp them out.
- We could especially use help checking code snippets — if you have more than a couple of year's experience with a language.
- If you see ways to improve the article (with examples, code, figures, whatever), that would be good for the author to hear.
- The _52 Things_ books are supposed to be fun as well as informative. If you see ways to lighten the content, let the authors know.


## How to review

I'm not certain of the best way to do this. Let's try this:

- Leave your name in [the table on the main page](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things).
- [Add an issue](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things/issues), tagging the author and giving the title (some authors have multiple essays), and list your remarks about the manuscript in the issue body.
- Add one issue per manuscript you review. 
- Any other issues or concerns, please email [Matt](matt@agilescientific.com).
