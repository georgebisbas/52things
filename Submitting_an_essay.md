# Thank you for thinking about writing for 52 Things!

We're collecting advice and stories &mdash; the sort of honest, candid advice and stories you usually only hear in pubs &mdash; about geocomputing. 'Geocomputing' is anything in the insection of computers and rocks, or code and earth science. Someone, somewhere sent you to this page because they think you have a story, or can share some advice, that others in the community will want to read.

We've done our best to make it easy to submit. You can write to the editor, Matt, at matt@agilescientific.com. You can make a pull request to this repo. Or yu can probably get back to the person who sent you this way. And don't worry too much about style or layout or anything like that: we love editing! (We'll run the edited version by you, of course.)

## Making a submission

- **Submissions are closed. If you think you have a contribution to make, please contact Matt Hall or Matteo Niccoli.**
- Read the [author instructions](https://www.agilelibre.com/authors).
- Look at some existing chapters to see the style and follow it as closely as you can.
- Chapters should be about 600 words. A figure or two is OK, and code is more than welcome.
- [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and add your chapter, preferably in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 
- If you prefer, [email it to me](mailto:matt@agilescientific.com).
- If you know about some openly licensed (preferably CC-BY) content that would work, please submit that, or just [let me know](mailto:matt@agilescientific.com).
- Add your bio to `bios`, your B&W hi-res headshot to `headshots`, and any figures to `figures` like `figures/yourname_fig1.png`.
- Mark code in your chapter by indenting with 4 spaces.
- Add a row to the table in [README.md](README.md).
- [Make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) back to this repo.

## A word about figures

- Usually there's only room for 1 or 2 figures.
- The book is black and white, please consider this when making figures.
- Figures are reproduced full-width on the page, so aim for 'landscape' orientation. Put smaller or squarer figures side-by side (see below).
- Please provide an SVG or PDF if you can.
- If you provide a raster, PNG is better than JPG
- If you provide a raster, please make it very large: at least 4000 pixels across.
- If you provide a raster, please provide the 'raw' image with no annotation as well as a 'complete' figure with the annotation. I usually end up redrawing figures with the book's fonts etc, and this is easier with a blank slate.
