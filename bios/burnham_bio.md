Brian received a Bachelor’s degree in Geosciences and Arts & Technology from the University of Texas at Dallas where he worked with both geologists and digital artists to develop methods to visualise and quantitatively analyse 3D outcrop models. He continued with 3D outcrop work to finish a Master’s degree before travelling “across the pond” to pursue a PhD at the University of Manchester. Throughout his research career Brian has specialised in geometric and architectural characterisation and quantitative analysis of 3D outcrop models. He currently works at the University of Aberdeen as a Research Fellow where he develops methods to quantitatively characterise and model subseismic-scale features from 3D outcrop analogues.
