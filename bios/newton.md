Tyler Newton is a PhD Candidate at University of Oregon researching the mechanics and morphology of faults using nodal seismometers and computers. His exposure to programming languages began unconventionally while working as a machinist, programming metalworking machines in G-code. He later worked on astrophysics projects in IDL while earning a BSc from University of Maryland, subsequently shifting to data analysis in MATLAB while working as a consultant at ERM, and most recently migrating to Python for its flexibility during his PhD.
