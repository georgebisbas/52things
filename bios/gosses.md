Justin is a data scientist. As a S.A.I.C. contractor for NASA, he supports the Office of the Chief Information Officer's Data Analytics team infusing modern data analytics into the non-science and non-engineering parts of NASA though consulting and prototypes. He also supports NASA's open-innovation program focused on code sharing internally and externally. Before NASA, Justin spent ten years as an oil and gas geologist where he learned how to code after maxing out the memory on Excel too many times. Justin keeps one toe in geology via side projects, which you can checkout at http://justingosses.com/code.
