Martin is South African, with undergraduate education in geology and computer science from Rhodes University, in Makhanda. Recently submitted a MSc in Geology (although it is really geophysics) at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth. Spent some time in between working for a geotechnical consulting firm. Likes maps, data, computers, and mashing all of those together. Has a blog at https://blog.martinb.za.net but does not use it much.
