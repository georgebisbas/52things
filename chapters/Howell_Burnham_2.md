## The Virtual Geoscience Revolution: Beyond Lidar – the democratization of Virtual Outcrops 
> John Howell and Brian Burnham

### Stage 4 - Beyond basic LIDAR 
Helimap, a Swiss company, developed a method of mounting the LIDAR scanner into a helicopter which borrowed an inertial navigation system from a Cruise Missile (Vallet & Skaloud, 2004). The creation of heli-lidar increased the practical size of virtual outcrops from less than 1km to 10’s of km. Suddenly, huge datasets could be collected from seismic scale outcrop sections such as the Book Cliffs in Utah and the Karoo in South Africa (Buckley et al,. 2008). 
A second advance that occurred in 2006 was the co-registration of hyper-spectral imagery of the cliff sections. Using long range infrared sensors, similar to those used for satellite remote sensing (1100 – 2500 nm), it was possible to automatically map lithology and mineralogy from cliff sections and drape classified images directly onto the virtual outcrop (Kurz et al., 2011). 

These advances, and the large datasets being collected, required software to visualise and interpret the data. While some software was modified to handle the 3D data, the key step came when two software packages were developed in parallel, VRGS at the University of Manchester (Hodgetts et al., 2015) and LIME at Uni Research in Bergen (Buckley et al., 2019).  Both of these packages were specifically designed to deal with virtual outcrop data with a suite of interpretation tools, and they ran well on standard desktop PCs or even laptops. Virtual Outcrops had arrived! 

### Stage 5 – Drones and Photogrammetry: The democratisation of virtual outcrops 
By 2010 a number of different groups were collecting, processing and using virtual outcrops. However due to the cost of the hardware (a typical LIDAR was in excess of £100,000) and the time consuming nature of acquisition and processing, it was still a specialist tool. This all changed with the advent of two parallel but unrelated advances. The first of these was the resurgence of photogrammetry and the release of a new set of algorithms called Structure from Motion (SfM). Photogrammetry is the concept of picking corresponding points on a series of pictures of an object, taken from different locations, and using this to reconstruct the scene in 3D. While the concept has been around almost as long as photographs, it wasn’t until the advent of SfM in the mid 2000’s, coupled with advances in computer processing power, that it became a practical methodology for building large 3D models of  outcrops. 

The advent of SfM also coincided with the emergence of cheap consumer UAVs (drones), with high quality cameras that could take hundreds of photos of outcrops from optimal angles. Drones, combined with SfM meant that all of a sudden, anyone could build 3D virtual outcrops – and they did. By 2018, virtual outcrops had become commonplace and almost anyone working on outcrop geology was collecting and utilising them. A drone has become a standard piece of field kit and data from a 20 minute flight are processed in a few hours to produce an accurate, 3D photorealistic model of a cliff section of interest, that can be interpreted on a laptop. For the first time in 200 years we are no longer reliant on recording geological information on 2D maps using coloured pencils. The Virtual Geoscience Revolution had arrived. 

### The Future 
The Virtual Geoscience Revolution is in its early days; as more people adopt the technologies, significant advances will come. Virtual Field trips, Virtual Reality (Fig. 2a), Machine Learning and automated interpretation under taken by Artificial Intelligent systems, vast datasets (Big Data) and cloud-based repositories are all coming. These technologies are fundamentally changing outcrop geology; the future of envisaging the subsurface (Fig. 2b) is once again very exciting!
